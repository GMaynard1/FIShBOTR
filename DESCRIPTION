Description: This packages provides R helper functions to make use of the FIShBOT
  dataset. Fishing Industry Shared Bottom Oceanographic Timeseries (FIShBOT) is 
  a standardized in-situ gridded bottom temperature product derived from 
  cooperative research data streams. The data are collected by commercial fishermen
  operating in US waters of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. To improve efficiency, 
  the data are stored   as a table online. This package converts the data back to 
  a grid and provides a number of functions to facilitate analysis.
